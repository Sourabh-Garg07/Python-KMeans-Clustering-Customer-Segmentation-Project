# Python-KMeans-Clustering-Customer-Segmentation-Project

# Project Overview 

This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using KMeans clustering. The project involves several steps, including data cleaning, data normalization, and clustering, utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

# Steps Involved

# 1. Data Cleaning
Loading Data: Imported the dataset using Pandas.
Handling Missing Values: Identified and handled missing values by either imputing or removing them.
Removing Duplicates: Detected and removed duplicate entries to ensure data uniqueness.
Text Cleaning: Standardized text formats by trimming whitespace and converting text to lowercase.

# 2. Data Normalization
Scaling Features: Used StandardScaler from Scikit-learn to normalize the data, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.

# 3. Customer Segmentation

KMeans Clustering:
Choosing the Number of Clusters: Used the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Fitting the Model: Applied the KMeans algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups.
Cluster Analysis: Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster to understand the different customer segments.

# 4. Visualization
Matplotlib: Utilized Matplotlib to visualize the clusters and the distribution of customers within each segment.
Cluster Centers: Plotted the cluster centers to interpret the key characteristics of each segment.

# Tools and Technologies

Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Scikit-learn: For implementing KMeans clustering and data normalization.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the results.

# Conclusion
This project successfully segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. The insights derived from this segmentation can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
